Perceptron algorithm based on Christianini &amp; Shawe-Taylor (2000)

Perceptron Algorithm (PLA) based on Christianini & Shawe-Taylor (2000)
Input:
perceptron(X,Y, 𝜂 ,max_iter=300)
X is an array of np.array vectors

Y is an np.array of label of all x vectors

𝜂  is the learning rate

max_iter is the maximum amount of iterations

Output:
(w,b,k)
w is a vector containing all the weights

b is "tbd"

knumber of times the weights were adjusted
